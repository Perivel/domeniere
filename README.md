# Domeniere
Domeniere is a library to assist in creating framework-independent Typescript applications.

# How Domeniere Fits into Your Architecture

# How Domeniere Helps
**Clean Architecture**: Domeniere helps keep your architectures small, simple, and clean.
**Create Portable Applications**: Domeniere makes no assumptions as to which Framework, Database, or external services you are using. Instead the details of these services can be injected to work with your Domeniere application.

# Domain Drien Design
Domeniere makes use of a lot of concepts from [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/tags/domain%20driven%20design.html).

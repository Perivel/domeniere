# Building Your Application
Since all Domeniere Applications are just regular Typescript NodeJS projects, building your Domeniere application is very strightforward. The goal of the Domeniere Build Process is to generate a library we can use in our environment.

All Domeniere applications come with a default built script in its `package.json` file. So, we can build our application by running the following command.
```
npm run build

or

yarn build
```
Once the build process completes, we are ready to use it in our environment.

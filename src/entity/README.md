# Entity
An entity is any object defined primarily by it's identity. Entities have
life cycles that can drastically change their form or content. Therefore, 
a thread of continuity must be maintained. An entity has a unique 
predefined identity in which it's definition, responsibilities, and 
attributes revolve around.
